File Search, Analysis & Archiving in Linux

This lab trains students in using command-line tools to locate, inspect, and search through text files, especially within large archives. It builds essential skills in system administration and file forensics using Linux.
Learning Objectives
•	- Extract compressed archive files using bunzip2 and tar.
•	- Search for files by name, extension, and content using find and grep.
•	- Understand and apply file modification and creation timestamp analysis.
•	- Locate files by size and frequency of use.
•	- Use sed, sort, and uniq to explore data trends in large files.
•	- Answer analytical questions using Linux command-line tools.

Lab Setup and Steps
•	- Download `gutenberg.tar.bz2` from LMS.
•	- Extract with: `bunzip2 gutenberg.tar.bz2` then `tar -xvf gutenberg.tar`.
•	- Explore contents: `ls -l`, `tree`, or use `less` to inspect a few files.
•	- Search for filenames: `find ./Gutenberg -name "*.txt"`.
•	- Search for strings: `grep -r 'keyword' ./Gutenberg` or use `find -exec grep`.
•	- Search with context: `grep -r -C 3 'Next day' ./Gutenberg`.
•	- Search by size: `find ./Gutenberg -type f -size 255258c -exec ls -lh {} \;`.
•	- Search by creation/modification date: `find -type f -printf '%T+ %p\n' | sort`.
•	- Find largest files: `du -a ./Gutenberg | sort -nr | head`.
•	- Analyze frequency in files: `sed -e 's/\s/\n/g' < file.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -200`.

🔎 Activity: File Extraction, Searching & Pattern Analysis (Gutenberg Archive)
📘 Objective
Learn to extract compressed archives and apply advanced command-line file search techniques (by filename, content, date, size) to solve real problems on a Linux filesystem.

📦 Deliverables

#	Deliverable	Description

✅ 1	Archive Extracted Successfully	Screenshot or terminal log of:
• bunzip2 Gutenberg.tar.bz2 
• tar -xvf Gutenberg.tar

To extract bzips2 package requires to install bunzip2 and tar in Linux

- Purpose: Decompresses .bz2 files (created by bzip2).
- Package: Comes from the bzip2 package.
- Install (if missing):
sudo apt install bzip2      

tar
- Purpose: Archives multiple files into one .tar file; often used with compression (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2, etc.).
- Package: Comes from the tar package.
- Install (if missing):
sudo apt install tar        

Common Use Together
To extract a .tar.bz2 file:
tar -xvjf archive.tar.bz2

- x: extract
- v: verbose (optional)
- j: use bunzip2
- f: file name


✅ 2	File Listing of Extracted Directory	Output of ls -l or tree 
structure showing contents of extracted files (confirming successful extraction).

✅ 3	Filename Search Demonstrated	Command and result for: 
• find . -name "*.txt" or similar extension-based search

✅ 4	Text Search via Grep	Output and command used for: 
• grep -r "verdigris" . or equivalent Ishmael.

I did not manage to find the “verdigris” text in the via Grep instead I 
searched for Ishmael and it searched successfully for it.

grep -r "verdigris" #no such word
grep -r " Ishmael " #found

✅ 5	Contextual Text Search	Output of grep -r -C 3 "Next day there was a surprise for Jack" . showing the following word

✅ 6	Date-Based File Searches	Outputs and commands for: 
• 3rd oldest file: `find ... -printf '%T+ %p\n'

✅ 7	Size-Based File Searches	Output of: 
• find . -type f -size 255258c -exec ls -lh {} \; (or 16) 
• Search for files +512k in size

I did not manage to search for the file size of 255258 bytes instead
I searched for 16 bytes and it searched successfully for it.
find . -type f -size 255258c -exec ls {} \; #did not find any file
find . -type f -size 16c -exec ls {} \; #found

✅ 8	Largest Files Found	Output of: 
• `du -a .

✅ 9	Text Frequency Analysis Performed	Output of:
• `sed -e 's/\s/\n/g' < file.txt

✅ 10	Answers to Questions Provided	All 5 questions answered: 
1. "verdigris" count 
    0

2. Author surname of 1107.txt
  Cannot find
  
3. Author of file that is 255258 bytes
 Cannot find

4. 3rd oldest file by creation date
2025-07-07+15:18:55.9473588000 ./frankenstein.txt
   
5. Word following "Next day there was a surprise for Jack"
Cannot find
