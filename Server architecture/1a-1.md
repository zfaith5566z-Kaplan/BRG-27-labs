Lab Objective

This lab is designed to help students set up a Linux environment on their personal or lab computers using virtualization technologies. By the end of this session, students should be able to install VirtualBox (or equivalent), download and boot an Ubuntu-based Linux image, and gain exposure to the process of configuring network settings in a virtualized environment.

Setup Instructions
1. Download ubuntu ISO image
2. Saving under the default directory
3. Mount the ISO ubuntu image saved in my downloads file.
4. Ensure the green tick at the end of the field to proceed to the next step
5. Ensure that "Proceed with Unattended Installation" is ticked if you do not want to customise the settings on your own.
6. Under the Set up....OS installation, you can leave the user name as default "vboxuser".
7. Set up your passwords 
8. Specify virtual hardware by setting 8GB RAM (Base memory), 2CPUs.
9. Specify virtual hard disk by setting 20GB under "Create a New Virtual Hard Disk" and click "Finish"


ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
#	Deliverable	Description
âœ… 1	VirtualBox Installed	Screenshot showing VirtualBox successfully installed on host OS (Windows, Mac, or lab environment).
âœ… 2	Ubuntu ISO Downloaded	Show that a valid .iso image (Ubuntu or Lubuntu) was downloaded from the official site.
âœ… 3	New Virtual Machine Created	Screenshot of VM settings in VirtualBox: name, RAM (e.g., 2048 MB), boot order, and ISO mounted as virtual CD.
âœ… 4	Ubuntu Installation Completed	Screenshot of Ubuntu desktop or terminal prompt after installation finishes and the VM is rebooted.
âœ… 5	Networking Mode Configured (Bridged or NAT)	Screenshot of VirtualBox network settings showing either NAT (for isolated use) or Bridged (for bi-directional testing).
âœ… 6	Ubuntu Running with GUI or CLI Access	Screenshot of a terminal window (CLI) or full GUI desktop to confirm OS is functional.
âœ… 7	(Optional) VirtualBox Guest Additions Installed	Evidence of running sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-utils and virtualbox-guest-x11 (if GUI is used), followed by reboot.
âœ… 8	SSH Enabled (for Advanced Users)	Proof that OpenSSH is installed and that the VM can be accessed using ssh from host OS (for those setting up a bridged network).
âœ… 9	(Alternate) WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) Installed	If VirtualBox isn't used, evidence of Ubuntu running in WSL, including installation steps via PowerShell and successful launch.
âœ… 10	(Bonus) Different Distro Explored	Notes or screenshot showing installation or exploration of another Linux distro (e.g., Fedora, Debian, Kali) in a second VM.

Reflection Questions

1. What challenges did you encounter during the virtual machine setup?
Ensuring the ISO and configuring networking booted correctly were the main challenges. I also had to fine-tune VM resource allocation, I had to ensure it ran smoothly without hampering my host PC resources.

2. What did you learn about virtualisation tools and their differences?
VirtualBox is an open-source software used for educational purposes, while VMware  provides performance-grade performance and integration suitable for enterprise. The choice depends on whether the goal is learning, development, or production simulation.

3. How confident do you feel using Ubuntu after completing this lab?
I feel moderately confident as I practice more with navigating the file system, install packages, and performing basic administrative tasks. Learning the basic commands for Ubuntu plays a part in managing services and configurations comfortably as well.

4. In what ways can a virtualised Linux environment help in industry scenarios?
Ideally, safe testing and integration of new applications. Running multiple servers on a single host. Simulation of real-world infrastructure for troubleshooting and experimentation.

5. What would you do differently if setting up another VM?
I would enquire from my clients on what they require first before setting the standard disk size and RAM allocation for their requirements , draft the setup steps with my team and document it, and test different network modes early on to avoid confusion later.
