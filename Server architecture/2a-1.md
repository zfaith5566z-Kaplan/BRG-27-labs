Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis

This lab introduces the concept of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) using printers as a scenario. Students will gather specifications and costs, define assumptions, and calculate the TCO of different printer models. They will then analyse and reflect on cost-based decisions in IT procurement.

Learning Objectives
â€¢	- Define TCO and identify components of fixed and variable costs.
â€¢	- Use spreadsheets to compare TCO across printer types (e.g., inkjet vs laser).
â€¢	- Make informed assumptions and document them clearly.
â€¢	- Evaluate decisions based on calculated TCO data.
â€¢	- Compare cost models for home vs business use cases.

Lab Instructions
â€¢	- Choose two printers to compare (e.g., budget inkjet vs office laser).
â€¢	- List all potential costs (fixed and variable). Examples: printer, cartridges, paper, power, service.
â€¢	- Define your assumptions: time period (5 years), weekly usage (750 pages), power on (40 hrs/week).
â€¢	- Use online sources (e.g., Officeworks, eBay, OEM manuals) to gather pricing and specs.
â€¢	- Calculate total quantity of consumables required for each printer over the chosen period.
â€¢	- Create or use a spreadsheet to total all costs (use formulas).
â€¢	- Compare final TCO values and reflect on the results.

Spreadsheet Components (Columns to Include)
â€¢	- Item Description
â€¢	- Type (Fixed/Variable)
â€¢	- Unit Price
â€¢	- Units Consumed (based on assumptions)
â€¢	- Total Cost (Unit Price Ã— Units Consumed)

Example Assumptions to Use
â€¢	- Comparison period: 5 years
â€¢	- Pages printed per week: 750
â€¢	- Power usage per week: 40 hours
â€¢	- Cost of electricity per kWh: check local provider (e.g., $0.30)
â€¢	- Cost of paper (ream of 500): e.g., $6
â€¢	- Ink yield per cartridge: refer to specs (e.g., 500 pages)

ðŸ“˜ Objective

To understand and apply the TCO methodology by comparing two printers over a specified period, incorporating fixed and variable costs, and interpreting the results for decision-making.

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables

#	Deliverable	Description

âœ… 1	Printer Models Chosen	Identify and list two printers with brand, model, and type (e.g., Inkjet vs Laser). State if they are: 
â€¢ Entry-level home vs office-class printer 
â€¢ Personal vs workgroup

âœ… 2	Cost Assumptions Documented	Clearly list all assumptions used in calculations: 
â€¢ Period (e.g., 5 years) 
â€¢ Pages printed per week (e.g., 750) 
â€¢ Weekly runtime (e.g., 40 hrs) 
â€¢ Lifespan of printer, cartridge yield, paper per ream, electricity rate

âœ… 3	List of Expense Items	Categorize into: 
â€¢ Fixed costs (e.g., printer, extra accessories) 
â€¢ Variable costs (e.g., paper, ink/toner, electricity, replacement parts)

âœ… 4	Unit Costs Sourced	Web links and sources for each item (e.g., from Officeworks, eBay): 
â€¢ Printer price 
â€¢ Ink/toner cost per unit 
â€¢ Yield per cartridge 
â€¢ Paper ream price 
â€¢ kWh electricity rate

âœ… 5	Spreadsheet Calculation (TCO Model)	A well-structured spreadsheet with: 
â€¢ Quantity Ã— Unit Cost = Total per item 
â€¢ Separate totals for fixed and variable costs 
â€¢ Grand Total: Total Cost of Ownership (for 5 years) per printer

âœ… 6	Cost per Page Computed	Show TCO Ã· Total Pages = Cost per Page (e.g., $0.03/page) for each printer

âœ… 7	Break-even Analysis Table/Chart	Optional but encouraged: table or graph showing over time (e.g., 1â€“10 years) where the TCO for both printers becomes equal

âœ… 8	Reflection Questions Answered	Written response addressing:
â†’ Which printer has lower TCO and why?		
â†’ Would the choice change if only 5 pages/week were printed?		
â†’ What other qualitative or intangible factors could be considered (e.g., print speed, brand support, reliability)?		
â†’ For a large workgroup printer, what cost/performance specs would you now prioritize?		
â†’ Estimate the breakeven time point where both printers cost the same.		

âœ… 9	Optional: Sensitivity Analysis	Explore what happens when:
â€¢ Pages/week increase or decrease		
â€¢ Toner/paper costs fluctuate		
â€¢ Energy costs rise (optional but insightful)		






Reflection Questions

- Based on the TCO, which printer is the most cost-effective over 5 years?

Canon PIXMA G3260 is the clear winner.
Canon Total Cost (5 Years): $2,793.66 
Brother Total Cost (5 Years): $5,824.34. 
Canon saves $3,030.68 over 5 years primarily due to lower cartridge and
power costs. 
As the cost favors Canon for home user who prints only 5 pages per week.

â€¢ 	Low-volume printing (5 pages/week = 1,300 pages over 5 years) means:
â€¢ 	Fewer cartridges required (likely just 1 black ink bottle for Canon vs. 1 toner for Brother)
â€¢ 	Power usage becomes negligible for Canon (22.88 kWh vs. 832 kWh for Brother)

In low-volume scenarios, Canon remains more cost-effective and avoids overpaying for high-capacity toner and power-hungry hardware.

- What other non-financial factors could influence printer selection?
FactorCanon PIXMA G3260	Brother HL-L2460DW
Print speed	Slower ( 10 -15ppm)	Faster (30 + ppm
Reliability	Good for consumer	Industry grade 
Driver support	Basic	Linux / enterprise
Noise level	Quiet	Louder when active
Foot print	Compact	Large and heavy
Environmental 	Lower power, less waste	Higher power, more waste
Print quality 	Better for photos	Sharper text quality 

- What cost components are more significant for a large workgroup printer?
For high-volume environments, prioritize:
â€¢	Toner Yield: High-capacity cartridges (â‰¥10,000 pages)
â€¢	Print Speed: â‰¥35 ppm to avoid bottlenecks
â€¢	Monthly Duty Cycle: â‰¥20,000 pages
â€¢	Paper Handling: Large input trays (â‰¥500 sheets), duplexing
â€¢	Power Efficiency: ENERGY STAR certified
â€¢	Maintenance & SLA: Predictable service costs, fast support
â€¢	Security Features: PIN printing, user authentication
â€¢	Network Integration: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, AirPrint, LDAP
These specs ensure performance, scalability, and predictable cost control.

- At what point (in years/pages) do the two printer options break even in cost?
Cost per Page (Cartridge Only):
â€¢	Canon:
o	Black: $17.99 Ã· 6,000 = $0.0030/page
o	Color: $13.99 Ã· 7,700 = $0.0018/page
o	Combined (weighted): â‰ˆ $0.0044/page
â€¢	Brother:
â€¢	$54.99 Ã· 3,000 = $0.0183/page
Breakeven Equation:
Let x = number of pages
Set total cost equal:
Canon_TCO = 149.99 + 100 + 1950 + 0.0044x  
Brother_TCO = 199.99 + 100 + 1950 + 0.0183x
249.99 + 0.0044x = 249.99 + 0.0183x  
â†’ 0.0044x = 0.0183x  
â†’ No solution
Conclusion:
Canon remains cheaper at all volumes up to 195,000 pages. There is no breakeven point where Brother becomes more cost-effective and justify the premium.
