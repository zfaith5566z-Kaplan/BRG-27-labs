This session introduces students to the Ubuntu Desktop and emphasises command-line use.
Students will explore file navigation, permissions, network tools, user management, and software installation via GUI and CLI.

Learning Objectives
•	- Understand the Ubuntu desktop and basic command-line interface (CLI).
•	- Use basic terminal commands for navigation, file handling, and user management.
•	- Explore system information, process monitoring, and networking tools.
•	- Understand software installation via GUI, APT, and source compilation.
•	- Compare public/private IPs and experiment with host configuration.
•	- Develop beginner C program and compile using GCC.

Part 1: Ubuntu Desktop GUI Familiarisation
•	- Check Internet using Firefox.
•	- Open LibreOffice and type a document.
•	- Navigate directories using File Manager.
•	- Install a program via Ubuntu Software Centre.
•	- Visualise file changes by placing terminal and file browser side-by-side.

Part 2: CLI Basics and File Operations
•	- Use `ps -e`, `top`, and `1` to monitor processes.
•	- Use `ls`, `ls -la`, `ls -alt`, `ls -lah` to explore files.
•	- Create/edit/view files using `touch`, `gedit`, `nano`, `cat`, `less`.
•	- Copy and move files with `cp`, `mv`; delete with `rm`.
•	- View system info using `uname -a`, `lsb_release -a`, `hostnamectl`.

Part 3: Super User and Permissions
•	- Use `whoami`, `sudo whoami` to demonstrate privilege escalation.
•	- Attempt `adduser` as sudoregular user, then with `sudo`.
•	- Discuss role of root user and best practices for privilege use.

Part 4: Network Configuration and DNS
•	- Use `ip a` to identify private IP.
•	- Ping local devices or 8.8.8.8 and discuss DNS.
•	- Edit `/etc/hosts` to create custom aliases; test with `ping`.
•	- Use `nslookup` and install/use `whois` to investigate domains.
•	- Compare public/private IP via https://whatismyipaddress.com/.

Part 5: System and Hardware Info
•	- Use `lsusb`, `lspci`, `less /proc/cpuinfo` to inspect hardware.
•	- Compare CLI outputs with 'About This Computer' in settings.
•	- Redirect output using `>`, e.g., `lsusb > output_of_lsusb`, then view with `less` and `cat`.

Part 6: Software Installation Methods
•	- Install a browser (Chrome/Opera) from a .deb file.
•	- Install apps via Ubuntu Software Centre.
•	- Use `sudo apt update`, `sudo apt upgrade`, `sudo apt install vlc`.
•	- Search packages with `sudo apt search [keyword]`.
•	- Explore `/etc/apt/sources.list` to discuss trusted repositories.

Part 7: Compiling from Source (Optional)
•	- Install build tools: `sudo apt install build-essential`.
•	- Write a basic `hello_world.c` and compile with `gcc`.
•	- Run the executable with `./hello_world_executable`.
•	- Adjust permissions with `chmod 777` if needed.
•	- Compare source and compiled file using `less`.

• Viewing output with less, cat 
• Deleting it with rm

✅ 12	Software Installed (3 Ways)	Evidence of all three: 
• SaaS (e.g. login to Office 365 or Google Docs in browser) 
• Binary download (e.g., .deb file like Chrome/Opera) 
• Repository install via Ubuntu Software Centre

✅ 13	Command-Line Install via apt	Evidence of: 
• sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade 
• sudo apt install vlc or other package 
• Optional: less /etc/apt/sources.list

✅ 14	Source Code Compilation	Deliverables: 
• File hello_world.c with source code 
• Compilation using gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world_executable 
• Execution with ./hello_world_executable 
• If needed: chmod 777 for permission fix

✅ 15	Reflection Summary (Paragraph)	A short reflection (100–200 words) covering: 
• GUI vs CLI experience 
• Software installation methods pros/cons (SaaS, repo, manual, source) 
• Your preference as a user and as a future software developer

Ans for Qs 15. Exploring Ubuntu through both GUI and CLI has highlighted the strengths of
    each interface. The GUI is intuitive and ideal for quick tasks like browsing
    software or adjusting settings. In contrast, the CLI offers precision, detailed for
    automation and troubleshooting. As a developer, the CLI’s features varies in flexibility
    and complexity such as software installation methods.
    SaaS is convenient-to-use and platform-independent but heavy reliant on constant
    internet access. Repositories are secure and system-integrated, offering automatic
    updates and dependency management. Manual downloads provide access to proprietary tools but require careful handling of dependencies. Source builds offer full customization but demand technical expertise and time.2
    Personally, I prefer CLI-based workflows and repository installs for their
    reproducibility and flexibility. As a future software developer, I emphasize the
    ability to script, log, and control every step of the environment setup. With
    each step these GUI tools can build and visualize for me what is helpful for
    onboarding, the CLI remains my primary interface for serious development and
    system management.
